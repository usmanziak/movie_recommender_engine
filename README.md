# Movie Recommender Engine

## What are recommendation systems and how do they work?



Every day, when we are shopping online, browsing Netflix, streaming music, and even typing a note on a smartphone, whether we realize it or not, we are contributing to and taking advantage of recommendation system algorithms.

A few decades ago, you would probably rely on your friends, family or experts for advice on what books you should read, movies you should watch, or restaurants you should try. However as we have progressed from the steam engine to the search engine, we are much more likely to rely on algorithms to help guide which purchases we make. For example, when we add a book to our cart on Amazon and then — bam — another suggested book pops up on the screen and we think, “Hey, that one actually looks pretty interesting, too” and we add it to our cart, too, without a second thought.

Recommendation systems with strong algorithms are at the core of today’s most successful online companies such as Amazon, Google, Netflix and Spotify. By endlessly recommending new products that suit their customers’ tastes, these companies provide a personalized, attentive experience across their brand platform, effectively securing customer loyalty.









This Content-Based Movie recommender engine is built using Python and the Scikitlearn library and is based on the IMDB 5000 movie dataset.
The recommender engine evaluates using CountVectorize and Cosine similarity scores.
